	    <h1>playing minecraft and making hardware</h1>

	    <p>
		i'm a random in a desert country (staying private) who likes to play minecraft. i also
		tried 2 linux distros and am currently making a computer based of the AM Tech's homemade cpu.
		i hope that it'll have more features but for now i'm done making the alu. i also believe
		that less is more. this is why this website has only a little bit of styling.

	    <h1>about this website</h1>

            <p>
	       i've collected a lot of skills throughout my life,
	       and i personally want to share them with you by
	       writing tutorials on my website. you'll find anything
	       from calligraphy to solving rubiks cubes here and
	       hopefully read at least one of them.
